    My great-great-<Relationship> once told me of a place called <Location>,
    where the <Animal>s roamed free and the rivers were clean.  Then the <Adjective>
    people from <Location> came and gave all the locals <Status>. Make sure to wash your hands and
    don't accept blankets from strangers!

q{
    There was once a mischevious boy who lived in <Location>,
    who yelled "<Monster>!" every once in a while to see
    the old people run and scare small children. Then one night
    a real <$1> came and when he yelled "<$1>!" no one believed him.
    And then it ate him.

q{
    In <Location> one summer's day a <Animal> was hopping about, <Policy_violation>ing to its heart's content.
    A <Monster> passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of <Food> he was taking to <Location>.
    "Why not come and <$2> with me," said the <$1>, "instead of toiling and moiling in that way?"
    "I am helping to <Policy_compliance>," said the <$3>, "and recommend you to do the same."

    "Why bother about winter?" said the <$1>; "We have got plenty of <Loot>s at present."  But the <$3> went
    on its way and continued its toil.  When the winter came the <$1> had no <$11>s and found itself dying of <Status>,
    while it saw the <$3>s distributing every day <Food> and <Food> from the stores they had collected in the summer.
    Then the <$1> knew: It is best to <Policy_compliance>.
},
q{
    One afternoon a <Animal> was walking through <Location> and spotted a bunch of <Food>s hanging from a lofty branch.
    "Just the thing to quench my <Status>," <It> said.
    Taking a few steps back, the <$0> jumped and just missed the hanging <$2>s.  Again the <$0> took a few paces back
    and tried to reach them but still failed.  Finally, giving up, the <$0> turned up <Its> nose and said,
    "<Rant>," and proceeded to walk away.
    It's easy to <Policy_violation>.

q{
    Did you hear about the boy who ran away because his parents took his <Loot>
    for <Policy_violation>ing? He fell out of a <Food> tree and died of
    <Status> because he <Policy_violation>d.

    A <Boss_monster>-esque explorer named <Legendary_warrior> addressed the<Club> with stories of his latest <Location>an safari.
    The<$2> was appalled as he described the effects of the <Animal>'s roar:
    "You feel it first in your <Body_part>. The <Body_part>s at the tip of your <Body_part> stand up.
    "The <Body_part>s on your <Body_part> become erect."
    <Boss_monster> interrupted him, saying, "I must take severe umbrage at your anatomical logic," to which <$1> replied,
    "I speak honestly, from the bottom of my <Body_part>."
    <$11> tilted his head at <$1> and said, slowly, deliberately, "<Rant>"

q{
    On one occasion a <Monster> stood up to test <Boss_monster>. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
    "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?" asked <$1>.
    The <$0> answered: "<Policy_compliance>, and love your <Relationship> as yourself."
    "You have answered correctly," he replied. "Do this and you will live."
    But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked <$1>, "and who is my <$5>?"
    In reply he said: "A <Monster> was going down from <Location> to <Location>, when <It> fell into the hands of <Monster>s.
    They stripped the <$8> of his <Garment>s, beat him and went away, leaving him with <Status> and no <$14>s.
    A <Monster> happened to be going down the same road, and when <It> saw the <$8>,
    <$18> passed by on the other side. But a <Monster>, as he traveled, came where the <$8> was,
    and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his <Body_part>s,
    pouring on <Soft_drink> and <Cocktail>. Then he put the <$8> on his own <Vehicle>, took him to <Location>,
    and took care of him. The next day he took out two <Material> coins and gave them to the innkeeper.
    'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will <Policy_compliance>."
    "Which of these three do you think was a <$5> to the <$8>?" asked <$1>.
    The <$0> replied, "the one who had mercy on him." <$1> told him, "Go and <Policy_compliance>."

q{
    In the early '90s, the first television commercial that ran showed two <Monster>s playing <Toy> under an orange, sunny sky,
    while a vocal jingle that included these lyrics was heard in the background: "<$1>...you got to win it in the fire, fire...<$1>"
    and "the action's getting hotter, really heating up, first you got to win it before you can stop." <$1> has achieved a small cult
    following mostly centered around the next commercial (which was memorable) and jingle that ran later in the same decade. This commercial
    features two young <Monster>s "sometime in the future" -- amidst smoke, lightning strikes, and a roaring crowd -- being introduced to and
    playing the game, ultimately resulting in the loser being spun off a life-sized <$1> arena into oblivion. Unlike the jingle of the
    first commercial, the jingle of the second one was highly stylized and featured fewer lyrics than the previous commercial's:
    "<$1>... you'll get caught up in the... <$1>" repeated, eventually ending with a dramatic yelling of the game's namesake
    (<$1>-YAAAAAH!) and a deep grunt. There are no more commercials made to advertise the board game.

    Turning and turning in the widening gyre
    The <Animal> cannot hear the <$0>r;
    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
    Mere <Status> is loosed upon the world,
    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
    Is moving its slow <Body_part>s, while all about it
    Intranet shadows of the indignant <Animal>s.
    The darkness drops again; but now I know

    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
